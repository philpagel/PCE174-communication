# PCE-174 light meter communication

This script implements the serial communication protocol used by the PCE-174
logging light meter.

The PCE-174 appears to be identical to the Extech HD450 light meter but as I
don't own the latter I have no way of testing this.  The user manual for the
Extech version of the instrument is quite a bit better than the PCE version, so
try and find it online...

See `protocol.md` for a detailed description of the communication protocol.


## Status

The script can send commands to control the instrument and request data from it:

* Live data: the current reading
* Saved data: the 99 registers for manually saved values
* Loggin data: entire logging sessions stored in instrument memory

I.e. all functionality that can be derived from the manufacturer protocol
documentation has been implemented. It is possible, however, that there are
undocumented functions.

I have carried out some testing of all functions but not extensively, so I'm
sure there still are relevant bugs. Therefore, this is not production ready but
should be considered "beta".

Feedback/bug reports are welcome.

Known issues:

* I am not sure what `memload` from the `Stat0` byte does. Once I find
  out I may change the name to reflect its meaning. I'll leave that to a later
  release.
* I have no idea what read_no in the live data records is supposed to mean.
* In logging mode, no sign is stored. That prevents the logging of negative
  values which can occur in rel mode when light intensity drops below the
  reference value. According to my tests this is not a problem because the
  logging function does not honor rel mode but rather records absolute values.
  this is kind of inconsistent as the rel flag IS recorded. Keep this in mind
  when logging.
* Sometimes the instrument stores invalid data like seconds > 59. This causes
  data processing to fail. You can still use raw, hex or construct format but
  repr and csv do not work in those cases...
  This is a bug in the instruments firmware - there is nothing I can do about it.


## Compatibility

The program was developed under Linux but it *should* work under Windows and
MacOS as well.  However this is untested. Please let me know if you have tried
this and I'll at least update this statement.

## Connecting to a computer

The light meter has a mini USB port. Upon connection to the computer the
instrument identifies as a CP2102 USB to UART bridge (device ID `10c4:ea60`). 

On my Debian Linux system, it is recognized out of the box; under Windows you
may need to install the respective driver (from the web or the Windows
software CD that comes with the instrument). Mac anyone?

Serial communication parameters are `9600bps8N1`. Or more verbosely:

parameter | value
----------|---------
baudrate  | 9600
byte size | 8
parity    | None
stop bits | 1
timeout   | None
xon/xoff  | False
rts/cts   | False


## Dependencies

You need Python 3 for this to work.

The program uses the `construct` library for parsing binary data which has
undergone major redesign during the switch to v2.8 that lead to loss of
backwards compatibility. Accordingly, versions of `construct` <2.8 will not
work!  Development and testing was carried out with v2.9.

You can find the construct library and documentation here:

https://github.com/construct/construct

https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

If it is not provided by your distribution just install a local version:

    pip install construct

It is also necessary to install pyserial, as follows:

    pip install pyserial

## Usage

To communicate with the light meter connect through USB and run the command
like this:

    usage: pce174 [-h] [-l] [-i INTERFACE] [-f {csv,repr,construct,raw,hex}]
                  [-T SAMPLING] [-F FILE] [-s SEP]
                  [command]

    Talk to a PCE-174 lightmeter/logger

    positional arguments:
      command               command to send to instrument

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -l, --list            list all available commands
      -i INTERFACE          interface to connect to (/dev/ttyUSB0)
      -f {csv,repr,construct,raw,hex}
                            specify output format (csv)
      -F FILE, --file FILE  parse previously saved raw data instead of reading
                            from the instrument
      -s SEP, --sep SEP     separator for csv (',')


On Linux, you might need to configure your user account to have access to
/dev/ttyUSB0. Alternatively you can run using sudo.

The following list describes all commands that are available as of now. The
command names were chosen to reflect what they do. Most of them correspond to

## Usage as a module

You can import this script as a module and call its functions directly. This may be handy
if you want to write your own software that needs access to the instrument.

In order for this to work, you need to rename the script to `pce174.py`. Without the extension
import will not work. Alternatively, a properly named symlink will do.

Example session:

    >>> import pce174
    
    >>> pce174.send_command('/dev/ttyUSB0', 'light')
    
    >>> dat = pce174.send_command('/dev/ttyUSB0', 'get-live-data')
    
    >>> dat
    b'\xaa\xdd\x00\x07\x02\x08\x15"$\x18\x00O\x00O\x01!c\x01\x02'
    
    >>> container = pce174.parse_live_data(dat)
    
    >>> container
    Container(magic=b'\xaa\xdd', year=7, weekday=2, month=8, day=21, hour=34, 
    minute=36, second=24, dat0H=0, dat0L=79, dat1H=0, dat1L=79, stat0=1, 
    stat1=33, mem_no=99, read_no=1)
    
    >>> pce174.process_live_data(container)
    {'date': '2007-08-15', 'mode': 'normal', 'APO': 'on', 'unit': 'lux', 
    'rawvalue': 7.9, 'hold': 'cont', 'value': 7.9, 'dispmode': 'time', 
    'power': 'low', 'mem_no': 99, 'read_no': 1, 'range': '400', 'memload': 
    'mem', 'time': '22:24:18'}

See pydoc and/or source code for function documentation.


## Data formats

Through the -f option you can choose from several output format options:

### csv

This is the most useful format for most purposes, as it can easily be imported
into other software.  The first row is the header declaring the column names.
The field separator is a comma (`','`), by default and can be chosen with the
`-s` option. Lines are separated by a single newline character (`\n`).


### repr

This format is the Python representation of the data. It is mostly useful for
debugging and possibly for use in other python programs although in the latter
case it's probably better to import the script as a module and use the data
directly as it is returned from the parse-XXX-data or process-XXX-data
functions.


### construct

This is the container representation of the construct library. For
debugging, only.


### raw

This format simply writes the binary blob to `STDOUT` as it is received from
the instrument.


### hex

Similar to raw but transcribed to hex representation.


## Saving raw data and paring it later

If you write raw data blobs into a file you can later parse it:

    pce174 get-saved-data -f raw > foo.dat
    
    pce174 get-saved-data -F foo

    pce174 get-saved-data -F foo -f repr

This may be useful, if you are not sure if you want the data in different formats, later or for debugging.
Also it may help for bug reports in order to reproduce the problem based on actual raw data.


## get-live-data

This command reads live data from the instrument. I.e. the current readings.
This can be used for single readings or automated logging from a computer
without using the logging feature of the instrument.  By default, the command
returns comma separated data (CSV) to `STDOUT`.  Example:

    date,time,value,rawvalue,unit,range,mode,hold,APO,power,dispmode,memload,mem_no,read_no
    2007-08-15,23:49:58,21.1,21.1,lux,400,normal,cont,on,ok,time,mem,27,12

The first row contains column headers with the following meaning:

Column    | Description
----------|-----------------------------------------------
date      | Date in ISO-8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
time      | Time (HH:MM:SS)
value     | Numerical value of reading
rawvalue  | raw numerical value 
unit      | Unit of measurement (lux/fc)
range     | Measurement range used (40, 400, ... 4000k)
mode      | normal/Pmin/Pmax/min/max/rel 
hold      | Was hold active? (hold/cont)
APO       | Auto-power-off (on/off)
power     | Power status (ok/low)
dispmode  | Active display mode (time/day/sampling/year)
memload   | No idea what this is (0/1/2). Name may change in the future.
mem_no    | Number of manually saved records in memory. (See get-saved-data)
read_no   | ?

In normal mode, `value` and `rawvalue` are identical. In *rel* mode however,
`rawvalue` contains the absolute reading (that would be measured without *rel*
mode) and `value` is the relative reading as displayed on the screen.

The binary data from the instrument includes a `weekday` field in the data
which is completely ignored by this script, because it has a few issues: The
weekday is a number (1-7) and manually set – i.e. the instrument does not try
to ensure that the weekday entry matches the date. In order to avoid confusion,
I decided to ignore the weekday. If you need the weekday, better compute it
from the date.


## get-saved-data

This command reads a table of manually saved data from the instrument.
By default, the command returns comma separated data (CSV) to `STDOUT`.
Example:

    pos,date,time,value,unit,range,mode,hold,APO,power,dispmode,memload
    1,2007-08-15,20:11:34,20.1,lux,400,normal,cont,on,ok,time,1
    2,2007-08-15,20:11:37,4.0,lux,4k,normal,cont,on,ok,time,1
    3,2007-08-15,20:11:40,0,lux,40k,normal,cont,on,ok,time,1
    4,2007-08-15,20:11:43,0,lux,400k,normal,cont,on,ok,time,1

The first row contains column headers with the following meaning:

Column    | Description
----------|-----------------------------------------------
pos       | Number of the storage position
date      | Date in ISO-8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
time      | Time (HH:MM:SS)
value     | Numerical value
unit      | Unit of measurement (lux/fc)
range     | Measurement range used (40, 400, ... 400k)
mode      | normal/Pmin/Pmax/min/max/rel 
hold      | Was hold active? (hold/cont)
APO       | Auto-power-off (on/off)
power     | Power status (ok/low)
dispmode  | Active display mode (time/day/sampling/year)
memload   | No idea what this is (0/1/2). Name may change in the future.

See get-live-data for details on other formats and weekday handling.


## get-logger-data

This command reads logger data from the instrument.
By default, the command returns comma separated data (CSV) to `STDOUT`.
Example:

    groupno,id,date,time,value,unit,range,mode,hold,APO
    1,0,2007-08-15,20:15:37,110.30000000000001,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    1,1,2007-08-15,20:15:39,110.0,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    1,2,2007-08-15,20:15:41,126.9,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    1,3,2007-08-15,20:15:43,96.30000000000001,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    2,0,2007-08-15,20:20:16,67.9,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    2,1,2007-08-15,20:20:18,66.60000000000001,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    2,2,2007-08-15,20:20:20,66.2,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    2,3,2007-08-15,20:20:22,76.9,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    2,4,2007-08-15,20:20:24,108.10000000000001,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    2,5,2007-08-15,20:20:26,108.0,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    2,6,2007-08-15,20:20:28,107.7,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    3,0,2007-08-15,20:12:15,38.0,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    3,1,2007-08-15,20:12:17,37.800000000000004,lux,400,normal,cont,on
    3,2,2007-08-15,20:12:19,54.1,lux,400,normal,cont,on


The first row contains column headers with the following meaning:

Column    | Description
----------|-----------------------------------------------
groupno   | numerical id of the logging group [1, 2, ...]
id        | measurement number within the group [0, 1, ...]
date      | YYYY-MM-DD
time      | HH:MM:SS

mode      | normal/Pmin/Pmax/min/max/rel 
hold      | Was hold active? (hold/cont)
APO       | Auto-power-off (on/off)

See get-live-data for details on other formats and weekday handling.


# Some useful things from the manual

Press `REC + UNITS` to enter setup.

Peak min/max mode is able to detect short high/low peaks with a 10ms
resolution.  Normal min/max mode is much slower than that.


## Manual value storage

Press `REC` to store current value in the next free position.

Press `REC + LOAD` to clear the storage.

Press & hold `LOAD` to view stored values.


## Data logger 

To start/stop logging press & hold `REC`.

To clear logger memory, press `REC` + Power while the meter is off.
